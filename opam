synopsis: "Coq library for reasoning about probabilistic algorithms"
description: """
  ProbHash extends coq-infotheo to support reasoning about probabilistic algorithms,
  and includes a collection of lemmas on random oracle based hash functions.

  Provides an example implementation of a bloom filter and uses the library to prove
  the probability of a false positive.
